- This project is called Dynamic Landing Page. This is the meaning of _**showing the current time and changing the background image according to morning, afternoon, and night.**_
- And also, that is allowed to enter a name and a motivation sentence. Besides these sentences are _**stored in local storage**_ so that's why these data don't lose even though the browser is closed.
- If you want to change the data that is entered by the user, you have to press Enter button so then your data will be saved to local storage.
- If you don't press the Enter button, so you will see an alert message that is "Press the Enter Button".
- Imagine that you change the data but you forget to press the enter button and skip other to tab or click anywhere on the same page, so you will see the same alert message.
